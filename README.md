## Project npm Scripts

These **requirements** should be fulfilled by the available npm scripts in this project:

1. Developer must be able to clone repository, run `npm start`, and have the program execute (✔️) without (❌) returning a non-zero exit code, regardless of the developer's Node and globally-installed package versions.
2. Developer must be able to know what version of Node.js is required to run the project by reading the contents of this project's `package.json` file. (❌)
3. Developer must be able to run an npm script that switches to the appropriate version of Node that's required to run the project, without knowing what that version is. (❌)
4. Developer must be able to know what version of npm was used to generate the `package-lock.json` file by reading the contents of this project's `package.json` file.
   (devDependency in `package.json`)

-   Developer must be able to run an npm script that "cleans up" the formatting of all files in the project.
    (`npm run prettier:fix`)
-   Developer must be able to run an npm script that fixes all fixable coding guideline violations in all the code in the project.
    (`npm run lint:fix`)
-   Developer must be able to run an npm script that fixes all fixable `npm audit` vulnerabilities.
    (`npm run audit:fix`)
-   Developer must be able to run an npm script that fixes all fixable CI rule violations before committing code.
    (`npm run build:fix`)
-   Developer must be able to run an npm script that checks for CI rule violations before committing code.
    (`npm run build:ci`)

The **npm scripts** available in this project:

-   `start` — Installs any missing packages and runs the TypeScript program within a context of the required environmental variables set.
-   `versions` — Displays the current versions of Node.js and npm.
-   `install:ci` — Deletes the `node_modules` folder and installs packages according to `package-lock.json` (_not_ `package.json`).
-   `install:local` — Installs any missing packages.
-   `outdated:ci` — Reports any packages with newer published version. Non-zero exit code if there are any.
-   `outdated:fix` — Updates any existing package to latest _minor_ and patch version, and saves the new version numbers to `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.
-   `outdated:fix:latest` — Updates all packages in `package.json` to latest _major_ version, and saves the new version numbers to `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.
-   `audit:ci` — Runs a security audit without making any changes. Non-zero exit code if it finds _any_-severity package vulnerability.
-   `audit:fix` — Updates packages that have security vulnerabilities, and saves the new version numbers to `package.json` and `package-lock.json`. Forces _major_ semver version changes if necessary.
-   `prettier:ci` — Checks if files conform to Prettier's styling rules. Non-zero exit code if violations are found.
-   `prettier:fix` — Automatically fixes Prettier styling violations by reformatting files. Run _before_ linting.
-   `lint:ci` — Checks for linting violations. Non-zero exit code if it finds _any_ violations.
-   `lint:fix` — Automatically fixes fixable linting violations. Run _after_ prettifying.
-   `build:ci` — Display tooling versions, delete `node_modules` and install packages from `package-lock.json`, exit if any npm packages are outdated, exit if there are _any_ security vulnerabilities, exit if there are any styling violations, and exit if there are _any_ linting violations.
-   `build:fix` — Display tooling versions, installs packages, update those packages and `package.json`` to latest _minor_ (or patch) versions, fix any security vulnerabilities by (if necessary) updating packages to latest _major_ versions, fix any style/formatting violations, and fix any linting violations.
-   `test:ci` — Runs the tests and generate code coverage to path `./coverage`. Non-zero exit code if any tests fail.
-   `test:local` — Runs the tests and generate code coverage to path `./coverage`.
-   `start:ci` — Runs the TypeScript program within a context of the required environmental variables set.
-   `start:fix` — Runs `build:fix`, then `start:ci`.
-   `precommit` — Runs `build:fix`, then `ci`. Useful for double-checking everything is ready for committing.
-   `ci` — Runs `build:ci`, then `start:ci`. The npm script the CI agent should run for pass/fail.

The typical **developer workflow** that results from using these scripts:

1. Clone repository.
2. `npm start` to see what it does/whether it appears to work.
3. Make changes to code.
4. `npm run start:fix` to validate the changes and their effects.
5. Make more change to the code based the prior changes' affect.
6. `npm run start:fix` again to validate the additional changes.
7. Iterate on the code and become annoyed by full `build:fix` every time.
8. `npm run start:ci`, instead, to skip the `build:fix` portion and just execute the code.
9. More iteration on code.
10. `npm run start:ci` to validate iterations quickly.
11. Ready to commit code.
12. `npm run precommit` to run full fix and validation process before submitting.

## Build and Continuous Integration (CI)

The **CI rules** a branch must pass to succeed build validation:

-   No package may be older than the latest minor and patch version.
-   No packages may have known security vulnerabilities of _any_ severity.
-   No npm script may rely on npm packages installed globally.
-   No files may have any formatting-style violations.
-   No code may have any coding guideline violations.
-   No unit tests may be failing.
-   The program must be able to execute without returning a non-zero exit code after building.
-   All the CI rules can be validated by running a single npm script (❌)

The **build artifacts** that should be published for by each build:

-   Test results
-   Code coverage results
-   NPM audit report (standalone, i.e. not stdout logs) (❌)
-   Report of licenses used by packages in this project (❌)
